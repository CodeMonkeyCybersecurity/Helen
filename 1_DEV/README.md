Here’s a detailed README.md for your NGINX setup:

NGINX HTTPS Setup with Certbot

This project sets up an NGINX web server using Docker Compose to serve static files with HTTPS enabled, leveraging Let’s Encrypt certificates generated by Certbot.

Features
	•	Lightweight NGINX container based on the nginx:alpine image.
	•	Automatic HTTPS certificate generation using Certbot.
	•	Support for serving custom static files from the html directory.
	•	Automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.
	•	Docker Compose for easy deployment and management.

Requirements
	•	Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server.
	•	A domain name (chickenj0.cloud) pointing to your server’s IP address.
	•	Certbot installed on your server for certificate generation.

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your server:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

2. Set up docker compose 

```
docker compose up -d
```

3. Configure SSL Certificates

Run the generate-cert.sh script to generate SSL certificates for your domain:

sudo ./generate-cert.sh

This script:
	•	Generates a Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate for your domain.
	•	Automatically configures NGINX to use HTTPS.
	•	Reloads the NGINX server to apply changes.

4. Start the NGINX Server

Start the NGINX server using Docker Compose:

docker-compose up -d

5. Verify the Setup
	•	Visit http://chickenj0.cloud to confirm HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
	•	Visit https://chickenj0.cloud to confirm the HTTPS certificate is working.

Configuration Details

docker-compose.yml

Defines the NGINX service, mapping ports, and mounting the html directory for static files. Includes the following key settings:
	•	Ports: Maps 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to the host.
	•	Volumes: Mounts the html directory for static content and certs directory for SSL certificates.

nginx.conf

Custom NGINX configuration for HTTPS with HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name chickenj0.cloud;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name chickenj0.cloud;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/nginx.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/nginx.key;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}

generate-cert.sh

Automates SSL certificate generation using Certbot and configures NGINX for HTTPS.

Troubleshooting
	1.	Certbot Not Installed:
Install Certbot and the NGINX plugin:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx


	2.	Port Conflicts:
Ensure no other services are using ports 80 or 443:

sudo netstat -tuln | grep -E '80|443'


	3.	DNS Issues:
Verify that your domain (chickenj0.cloud) points to your server’s IP address using a DNS lookup tool.
