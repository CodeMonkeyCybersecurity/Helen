Some example code to help you get started making your own websites and pages.

We also sometimes use the pages here as a knowledge base/reference if we have a brain-fade.

You should find all the code thoroughly and usefully commented.

Credit and attribution has been given where it is appropriate and we are very grateful to all those who put so much time and effort into helping others improve their knowledge and ability.

This is part of our effort to amplify the work of others and provide a knowledge base/example codebase for reference in our own development work.
